Simulation code for simulating concomitant field compensation for spiral turbo spin-echo imaging 

This repo focuses on recreating figure 3 - spatial phase addition due to concomitant fields for different gradient combinations.
The input data includes gradient waveforms which are fed in to the simulation calculation.
